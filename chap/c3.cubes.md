# III and IIIa. The Cube Groups.

We have here four groups to consider, all the members of which are triads, and have six funnels, opening on the six faces of a cube.

Boron, scandium and yttrium were examined; they are all triatomic, paramagnetic, and positive. The corresponding group consists of nitrogen, vanadium and niobium; they are triatomic, paramagnetic, and negative. We have not examined the remaining members of these groups. In these two groups nitrogen dominates, and in order to make the comparison easy the nitrogen elements are figured on both Plate XI and Plate XII. It will be seen that scandium and yttrium, of the positive group, differ only in details from vanadium and niobium, of the negative group; the ground-plan on which they are built is the same. We noted a similar close resemblance between the positive strontium and the negative molybdenum.

Plate XI.

### Boron (Plate III, 4, and Plate XI, 1).

We have here the simplest form of the cube; the funnels contain only five bodies — four six-atomed ovoids and one six-atomed "cigar." The central globe has but four five-atomed spheres. It is as simple in relation to its congeners as is beryllium to its group-members.

```

### Scandium (Plate XI, 2).

For the first time we meet funnels of different types, A and B, three of each kind; A appear to be positive and B negative, but this must be stated with reserve.

In A the boron funnel is reproduced, the "cigar" having risen above its companion ovoids; but the most important matter to note in respect to this funnel is our introduction to the body marked a 110. This body was observed by us first in nitrogen, in 1895, and we gave it the name of the "nitrogen balloon," for in nitrogen it takes the balloon form, which it also often assumes in other gaseous elements. Here it appears as a sphere — the form always assumed on the proto level — and it will be seen, on reference to the detailed diagram 4 a, to be a complicated body, consisting of six fourteen-atomed globes arranged round a long ovoid containing spheres with three, four, six, six, four, three, atoms respectively. It will be observed that this balloon appears in every member of these two groups, except boron.

The B funnel runs largely to triads, c and b, b (see 4 b) having not only a triadic arrangement of spheres within its contained globes, but each sphere has also a triplet of atoms. In c (see 4 c) there is a triadic arrangement of spheres, but each contains duads. B is completed by a five-atomed sphere at the top of the funnel. It should be noted that a, b and c all are constituents of nitrogen.

The central globe repeats that of boron, with an additional four-atomed sphere in the middle.

```

### Yttrium (Plate XI, 3).

Here we have a quite new arrangement of bodies within the funnel — the funnel being of one type only. Two "cigars" whirl on their own axes in the centre near the top, while four eight-atomed globes (see 4 e) chase each other in a circle round them, spinning madly on their own axes — this axial spinning seems constant in all contained bodies — all the time. Lower down in the funnel, a similar arrangement is seen, with a globe (see 4 d)—a nitrogen element — replacing the "cigars," and six-atomed ovoids replacing the globes.

The "nitrogen balloon" occupies the third place in the funnel, now showing its usual shape in combination, while the b globe (see 4 b) of scandium takes on a lengthened form below it.

The central globe presents us with two tetrahedra, recalling one of the combinations in gold (see Plate VII d), and differing from that only by the substitution of two quartets for the two triplets in gold.

One funnel of yttrium contains exactly the same number of atoms as is contained in a gaseous atom of nitrogen. Further, a, b, and d are all nitrogen elements. We put on record these facts, without trying to draw any conclusions from them. Some day, we — or others — may find out their significance, and trace through them obscure relations.

The corresponding negative group, of nitrogen, vanadium and niobium, is rendered particularly interesting by the fact that it is headed by nitrogen, which — like the air, of which it forms so large a part — pervades so many of the bodies we are studying. What is there in nitrogen which renders it so inert as to conveniently dilute the fiery oxygen and make it breathable, while it is so extraordinarily active in some of its compounds that it enters into the most powerful explosives? Some chemist of the future, perhaps, will find the secret in the arrangement of its constituent parts, which we are able only to describe.

Plate XII.

### Nitrogen (Plate XII, 1)

does not assume the cubical form of its relatives, but is in shape like an egg. Referring again to our 1895 investigations, I quote from them. The balloon-shaped body (see 4 a) floats in the middle of the egg, containing six small spheres in two horizontal rows, and a long ovoid in the midst; this balloon-shaped body is positive, and is drawn down towards the negative body b (see 4 b) with its seven contained spheres, each of which has nine atoms within it — three triads. Four spheres are seen, in addition to the two larger bodies; two of these (see 4 d), each containing five smaller globes, are positive, and two (see 4 c) containing four smaller globes, are negative.

### Vanadium (Plate XII, 2)

closely follows scandium, having two types of funnels. Funnel A only differs from that of scandium by having a globe (see 4 d) inserted in the ring of four ovoids; funnel B has a six-atomed, instead of a five-atomed globe at the top, and slips a third globe containing twenty atoms (see 4 d) between the two identical with those of scandium (see 4 c). The central globe has seven atoms in its middle body instead of four. In this way does vanadium succeed in overtopping scandium by 126 atoms.

```

### Niobium (Plate XII, 3)

is as closely related to yttrium as is vanadium to scandium. The little globes that scamper round the "cigars" contain twelve atoms instead of eight (see 4 e).

The rest of the funnel is the same. In the central globe both the tetrahedra have "cigars," and a central nine-atomed globe spins round in the centre (see 4 f), seventeen atoms being thus added.

## III a.

Aluminium, gallium and indium were examined from this group. They are triatomic, diamagnetic, and positive. The corresponding group contains phosphorus, arsenic and antimony: bismuth also belongs to it, but was not examined; they are triatomic, diamagnetic and negative. They have no central globes.

![](/img/p13.png)

Plate XIII. Plate XIII.

### Aluminium (Plate XIII, 1)

the head of the group, is, as usual, simple. There are six similar funnels, each containing eight ovoids, below which is a globe.

```

```

### Gallium (Plate XIII, 2)

has two segments in every funnel; in the segment to the left a "cigar" balances a globe, equally six-atomed, in that of the right, and the globes to right and left are four-atomed as against three-atomed. In the next row, the smaller contained globes have six atoms as against four, and the cones have respectively seven and five. By these little additions the left-hand funnel boasts one hundred and twelve atoms as against ninety-eight.

```

### Indium (Plate XIII, 3)

repeats the segments of gallium exactly, save in the substitution of a sixteen-atomed body for the seven-atomed cone of the left-hand segment, and a fourteen-atomed body for the five-atomed corresponding one in gallium. But each funnel now has three segments instead of two; three funnels out of the six contain two segments of type A and one of type B; the remaining three contain two of type B, and one of type A.

```

```

The corresponding negative group, phosphorus, arsenic, and antimony, run on very similar lines to those we have just examined.

![](/img/p14.png)

Plate XIV.

### Phosphorus (Plate XIV, 1)

offers us a very curious arrangement of atoms, which will give some new forms in breaking up. Two segments are in each funnel, in fact the only two of group III a which do not show this arrangement, or a modification thereof, are aluminium and arsenic.

```

```

### Arsenic (Plate XIV, 2)

resembles aluminium in having eight internal sub-divisions in a funnel, and the ovoids which form the top ring are identical, save for a minute difference that in aluminium the ovoids stand the reverse way from those in arsenic. It will be noted that in the former the top and bottom triangles of atoms have the apices upwards, and the middle one has its apex downwards. In arsenic, the top and bottom ones point downwards, and the middle one upwards. Arsenic inserts sixteen spheres between the ovoids and globe shown in aluminium, and thus adds no less than one hundred and forty-four atoms to each funnel.

### Antimony (Plate XIV, 3)

is a close copy of indium, and the arrangement of types A and B in the funnels is identical. In the middle rings of both A and B a triplet is substituted for a unit at the centre of the larger globe. In the lowest body of type A the "cigar" has vanished, and is represented by a seven-atomed crystalline form.

### Boron (Plate III, 4, and Plate XI, 1).

![](/img/boron.png)

Dissociation of Boron and Scandium.

The disintegration of boron is very simple: the funnels are set free and assume the spherical form, showing a central "cigar" and four globes each containing two triplets. The central globe is also set free with its four quintets, and breaks at once in two. On the meta level the "cigar" breaks up as usual, and the triplets separate. On the hyper level, the "cigar" follows its usual course, and the triplets become duads and units. The globe forms two quintets on the meta level, and these are resolved into triplets and duads.

### Scandium (Plate XI, 2).

In funnel A the "cigar" and the ovoids behave as in boron, but the "balloon," a 110 (XI, 4), escapes from the funnel as it changes to a sphere, and holds together on the proto level; on the meta, it yields six globes each containing seven duads, and these are all set free as duads on the hyper level; the ovoid is also set free on the meta level becoming a sphere, and on the hyper level liberates its contained bodies, as two triplets, two quartets and two sextets.

In funnel B there is a quintet, that behaves like those in the globe of boron, on escaping from the funnel, in which the bodies remain on the proto level, with the exception of b 63, which escapes. On the meta level, c (Plate XI, 4), c assumes a tetrahedral form with six atoms at each point, and these hold together as sextets on the hyper level. At the meta stage, b (Plate XI, 4 b) sets free seven nine-atomed bodies, which become free triplets on the hyper. The central globe shows a cross at its centre, with the four quintets whirling round it, on the proto level. On the meta, the quintets are set free, and follow the boron type, while the cross becomes a quartet on the meta level, and two duads on the hyper.

### Yttrium (Plate XI, 3).

![](/img/yttrium.png)

Dissociation of Scandium (continued) and Yttrium.

In yttrium, on the proto level, a 110 and b 63 both escape from the funnel, and behave as in scandium. The ovoids and "cigars," set free on the meta level, behave as in boron. The central globe breaks up as in gold (pp. 49 and 50), four quartets being set free instead of two quartets and two triplets. We have only to consider e 8 and d 20 (Plate XI, 4). E 8 is a tetrahedral arrangement of duads on the meta level, set free as duads on the hyper. D 20 is an arrangement of pairs of duads at the angles of a square-based pyramid on the meta, and again free duads on the hyper.

### Nitrogen (Plate XII, 1).

Nitrogen has nothing new to show us, all its constituents having appeared in scandium and yttrium.

### Vanadium (Plate XII, 2).

The A funnel of vanadium repeats the A funnel of scandium, with the addition of d 20, already studied. In the B funnel scandium B is repeated, with an addition of d 20 and a sextet for a quintet; the sextet is the c of the "nitrogen balloon." The central globe follows boron, save that it has a septet for its centre; this was figured in iodine (p. 48).

### Niobium (Plate XII, 3).

Niobium only differs from yttrium by the introduction of triplets for duads in e; on the meta level we have therefore triplets, and on the hyper each triplet yields a duad and a unit. The only other difference is in the central globe. The tetrahedra separate as usual, but liberate eight "cigars" instead of four with four quartets; the central body is simple, becoming three triads at the angles of a triangle on the meta level, and three duads and three units on the hyper.

### Aluminium (Plate XIII, 1).

![](/img/aluminium.png)

Dissociation of Aluminium and Gallium.

The funnels let go the globes, but the eight ovoids remain within them, so that seven bodies are let loose on the proto level. When the ovoids are set free at the meta stage they become spherical and a nine-atomed body is produced, which breaks up into triangles on the hyper level. The globe becomes a cross at the meta stage, with one atom from the duads at each arm in addition to its own, and these form four duads on the hyper, and a unit from the centre.

### Gallium (Plate XIII, 2).

In gallium the funnel disappears on the proto level, setting free its two contained segments, each of which forms a cylinder, thus yielding twelve bodies on the proto level. On the meta, the three upper globes in each left-hand segment are set free, and soon vanish, each liberating a cigar and two septets, the quartet and triad uniting. On the hyper the quartet yields two duads but the triangle persists. The second set of bodies divide on the meta level, forming a sextet and a cross with a duad at each arm; these on the hyper level divide into two triangles, four duads and a unit. The seven-atomed cone becomes two triangles united by a single atom, and on the meta level these form a ring round the unit; on the hyper they form three duads and a unit.

In the right-hand segment, the same policy is followed, the four triads becoming two sextets, while the central body adds a third to the number. The second ring has a quartet instead of the sextet, but otherwise breaks up as does that of the left; the quintet at the base follows that of boron.

### Indium (Plate XIII, 3).

The complication of three segments of different types in each funnel does not affect the process of breaking up, and indium needs little attention. A is exactly the same as the left-hand funnel of gallium, save for the substitution of a globe containing the familiar "cigar" and two square-based pyramids. B is the same as the right-hand funnel of gallium, except that its lowest body consists of two square-based pyramids and a tetrahedron. All these are familiar.

### Phosphorus (Plate XIV, 1).

![](/img/phosphorus.png)

Dissociation of Phosphorus and Antimony.

The atoms in the six similar spheres in the segments of the phosphorus funnel are arranged on the eight angles of a cube, and the central one is attached to all of them. On the meta level five of the nine atoms hold together and place themselves on the angles of a square-based pyramid; the remaining four set themselves on the angle of a tetrahedron. They yield, on the hyper level, two triads, a duad, and a unit. The remaining bodies are simple and familiar.

### Arsenic (Plate XIV, 2).

Arsenic shows the same ovoids and globe as have already been broken up in aluminium (see ante); the remaining sixteen spheres form nine-atomed bodies on the meta level, all similar to those of aluminium, thus yielding twelve positive and twelve negative; the globe also yields a nine-atomed body, twenty-five bodies of nine.

### Antimony (Plate XIV, 3).

Antimony follows closely in the track of gallium and indium, the upper ring of spheres being identical. In the second ring, a triplet is substituted for the unit, and this apparently throws the cross out of gear, and we have a new eleven-atomed figure, which breaks up into a triplet and two quartets on the hyper level. The lowest seven-atomed sphere of the three at the base is the same as we met with in copper.
