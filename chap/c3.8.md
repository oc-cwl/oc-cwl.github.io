## IV. The Octahedral Groups.

These groups are at the turns of the spiral in Sir William Crookes' lemniscates (see p. 28). On the one side is carbon, with below it titanium and zirconium; on the other silicon, with germanium and tin. The characteristic form is an octahedron, rounded at the angles and a little depressed between the faces in consequence of the rounding; in fact, we did not, at first, recognize it as an octahedron, and we called it the "corded bale," the nearest likeness that struck us. The members of the group are all tetrads, and have eight funnels, opening on the eight faces of the octahedron. The first group is paramagnetic and positive; the corresponding one is diamagnetic and negative. The two groups are not closely allied in composition, though both titanium and tin have in common the five intersecting tetrahedra at their respective centres.

Plate XV.

### Carbon (Plate III, 5, and XV, 1)

gives us the fundamental octahedral form, which becomes so masked in titanium and zirconium. As before said (p. 30), the protrusion of the arms in these suggests the old Rosicrucian symbol of the cross and rose, but they show at their ends the eight carbon funnels with their characteristic contents, and thus justify their relationship. The funnels are in pairs, one of each pair showing three "cigars," and having as its fellow a funnel in which the middle "cigar" is truncated, thus loosing one atom. Each "cigar" has a leaf-like body at its base, and in the centre of the octahedron is a globe containing four atoms, each within its own wall; these lie on the dividing lines of the faces, and each holds a pair of the funnels together. It seems as though this atom had been economically taken from the "cigar" to form a link. This will be more clearly seen when we come to separate the parts from each other. It will be noticed that the atoms in the "leaves" at the base vary in arrangement, being alternately in a line and in a triangle.

```

### Titanium (Plate III, 6, and XV, 2)

has a complete carbon atom distributed over the ends of its four arms, a pair of funnels with their linking atom being seen in each. Then, in each arm, comes the elaborate body shown as 3 c, with its eighty-eight atoms. A ring of twelve ovoids (3 d) each holding within itself fourteen atoms, distributed among three contained globes—two quartets and a sextet—is a new device for crowding in material. Lastly comes the central body (4 e) of five intersecting tetrahedra, with a "cigar" at each of their twenty points—of which only fifteen can be shown in the diagram—and a ring of seven atoms round an eighth, that forms the minute centre of the whole. Into this elaborate body one hundred and twenty-eight atoms are built.

```

### Zirconium (Plate XV, 3)

has exactly the same outline as titanium, the carbon atom is similarly distributed, and the central body is identical. Only in 5 c and d do we find a difference on comparing them with 4 c and d. The c ovoid in zirconium shows no less than fifteen secondary globes within the five contained in the ovoid, and these, in turn, contain altogether sixty-nine smaller spheres, with two hundred and twelve atoms within them, arranged in pairs, triplets, quartets, quintets, a sextet and septets. Finally, the ovoids of the ring are also made more elaborate, showing thirty-six atoms instead of fourteen. In this way the clever builders have piled up in zirconium no less than 1624 atoms.

Plate XVI.

### Silicon (Plate XVI, 1)

is at the head of the group which corresponds to carbon on the opposite turn of the lemniscate. It has the usual eight funnels, containing four ovoids in a circle, and a truncated "cigar" but no central body of any kind. All the funnels are alike.

```

### Germanium (Plate XVI, 2)

shows the eight funnels, containing each four segments (XVI, 4), within which are three ovoids and a "cigar." In this case the funnels radiate from a central globe, formed of two intersecting tetrahedra, with "cigars" at each point enclosing a four-atomed globe.

```

### Tin (Plate XVI, 3)

repeats the funnel of germanium, and the central globe we met with in titanium, of five intersecting tetrahedra, carrying twenty "cigars"; the latter, however, omits the eight-atomed centre of the globe that was found in titanium, and hence has one hundred and twenty atoms therein instead of one hundred and twenty-eight. Tin, to make room for the necessary increase of atoms, adopts the system of spikes, which we met with in zinc (see Plate IX, 2); these spikes, like the funnels, radiate from the central globe, but are only six in number. The twenty-one-atomed cone at the head of the spike we have already seen in silver, and we shall again find it in iridium and platinum; the pillars are new in detail though not in principle, the contained globes yielding a series of a triplet, quintet, sextet, septet, sextet, quintet, triplet.

## V. The Bars Groups.

![](/img/p17.png)

Plate XVII.

Here, for the first time, we find ourselves a little at issue with the accepted system of chemistry. Fluorine stands at the head of a group—called the inter-periodic—whereof the remaining members are (see Crookes' table, p. 28), manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel; ruthenium, rhodium, palladium; osmium, iridium, platinum. If we take all these as group V, we find that fluorine and manganese are violently forced into company with which they have hardly any points of relationship, and that they intrude into an otherwise very harmonious group of closely similar composition. Moreover, manganese reproduces the characteristic lithium "spike" and not the bars of those into whose company it is thrust, and it is thus allied with lithium, with which indeed it is almost identical. But lithium is placed by Crookes at the head of a group, the other members of which are potassium, rubidium and cæsium (the last not examined). Following these identities of composition, I think it is better to remove manganese and fluorine from their incongruous companions and place them with lithium and its allies as V a, the Spike Groups, marking, by the identity of number, similarities of arrangement which exist, and by the separation the differences of composition. It is worth while noting what Sir William Crookes, in his "Genesis of the Elements," remarks on the relations of the interperiodic group with its neighbours. He says: "These bodies are interperiodic because their atomic weights exclude them from the small periods into which the other elements fall, and because their chemical relations with some members of the neighbouring groups show that they are probably interperiodic in the sense of being in transition stages."

Group V in every case shows fourteen bars radiating from a centre as shown in iron, Plate IV, 1. While the form remains unchanged throughout, the increase of weight is gained by adding to the number of atoms contained in a bar. The group is made up, not of single chemical elements, as in all other cases, but of sub-groups, each containing three elements, and the relations within each sub-group are very close; moreover the weights only differ by two atoms per bar, making a weight difference of twenty-eight in the whole. Thus we have per bar:—

```
Iron             72        Palladium       136
Nickel           74        Osmium          245
Cobalt           76        Iridium         247
Ruthenium       132        Platinum A      249
Rhodium         134        Platinum B      257
```

It will be noticed (Plate XVII, 3, 4, 5,) that each bar has two sections, and that the three lower sections in iron, cobalt and nickel are identical; in the upper sections, iron has a cone of twenty-eight atoms, while cobalt and nickel have each three ovoids, and of these the middle ones alone differ, and that only in their upper globes, this globe being four-atomed in cobalt and six-atomed in nickel.

The long ovoids within each bar revolve round the central axis of the bar, remaining parallel with it, while each spins on its own axis; the iron cone spins round as though impaled on the axis.

```
Iron (Plate IV, 1, and XVII, 3):
        14 bars of 72 atoms            1008
        Atomic weight                 55.47
        Number weight 1008/18         56.00
        
Cobalt (Plate XVII, 4):
        14 bars of 74 atoms            1036
        Atomic weight                 57.70
        Number weight 1036/18         57.55
        
Nickel (Plate XVII, 4):

        Atomic weight                  58.30
        Number weight 1064/18          59.11
```

(The weight of cobalt, as given in Erdmann's Lehrbuch, is 58.55, but Messrs. Parker and Sexton, in Nature, August 1, 1907, give the weight, as the result of their experiments, as 57.7.)

![](/img/p18.png)

Plate XVIII.

The next sub-group, ruthenium, rhodium, and palladium, has nothing to detain us. It will be observed that each bar contains eight segments, instead of the six of cobalt and nickel; that ruthenium and palladium have the same number of atoms in their upper ovoids, although in ruthenium a triplet and quartet represent the septet of palladium; and that in ruthenium and rhodium the lower ovoids are identical, though one has the order: sixteen, fourteen, sixteen, fourteen; and the other: fourteen, sixteen, fourteen, sixteen. One constantly asks oneself: What is the significance of these minute changes? Further investigators will probably discover the answer.

```
Ruthenium (Plate XVIII, 1):
      14 bars of 132 atoms              1848

      Number weight 1876/18           104.22
      
Palladium (XVIII, 3):
      14 bars of 136 atoms              1904
      Atomic weight                   105.74
      Number weight 1904/18           105.77
```

The third sub-group, osmium, iridium and platinum, is, of course, more complicated in its composition, but its builders succeed in preserving the bar form, gaining the necessary increase by a multiplication of contained spheres within the ovoids. Osmium has one peculiarity: the ovoid marked a (XVIII, 4) takes the place of axis in the upper half of the bar, and the three ovoids, marked b, revolve round it. In the lower half, the four ovoids, c, revolve round the central axis. In platinum, we have marked two forms as platinum A and platinum B, the latter having two four-atomed spheres (XVIII, 6 b) in the place of the two triplets marked a. It may well be that what we have called platinum B is not a variety of platinum, but a new element, the addition of two atoms in a bar being exactly that which separates the other elements within each of the sub-groups. It will be noticed that the four lower sections of the bars are identical in all the members of this sub-group, each ovoid containing thirty atoms. The upper ring of ovoids in iridium and platinum A are also identical, but for the substitution, in platinum A, of a quartet for a triplet in the second and third ovoids; their cones are identical, containing twenty-one atoms, like those of silver and tin.

Osmium (Plate XVIII, 4):
       14 bars of 245 atoms            3430

## Va. The Spike Groups.

I place within this group lithium, potassium, rubidium, fluorine, and manganese, because of their similarity in internal composition. Manganese has fourteen spikes, arranged as in the iron group, but radiating from a central globe. Potassium has nine, rubidium has sixteen, in both cases radiating from a central globe. Lithium (Plate IV, 2) and fluorine (Plate IV, 3) are the two types which dominate the group, lithium supplying the spike which is reproduced in all of them, and fluorine the "nitrogen balloon" which appears in all save lithium. It will be seen that the natural affinities are strongly marked. They are all monads and paramagnetic; lithium, potassium and rubidium are positive, while fluorine and manganese are negative. We seem thus to have a pair, corresponding with each other, as in other cases, and the interperiodic group is left interperiodic and congruous within itself.

Plate XIX.

### Lithium (Plate IV, 2 and Plate XIX, 1)

is a striking and beautiful form, with its upright cone, or spike, its eight radiating petals (x) at the base of the cone, and the plate-like support in the centre of which is a globe, on which the spike rests. The spike revolves swiftly on its axis, carrying the petals with it; the plate revolves equally swiftly in the opposite direction. Within the spike are two globes and a long ovoid; the spheres within the globe revolve as a cross; within the ovoid are four spheres containing atoms arranged on tetrahedra, and a central sphere with an axis of three atoms surrounded by a spinning wheel of six.

### Potassium (Plate XIX, 2)

consists of nine radiating lithium spikes, but has not petals; its central globe contains one hundred and thirty-four atoms, consisting of the "nitrogen balloon," encircled by six four-atomed spheres.

```

(The weight, as determined by Richards [Nature, July 18, 1907] is 39.114.)

### Rubidium (Plate XIX, 3)

adds an ovoid, containing three spheres—two triplets and a sextet—to the lithium spike, of which it has sixteen, and its central globe is composed of three "balloons."

The corresponding negative group consists only of fluorine and manganese, so far as our investigations have gone.

### Fluorine (Plate IV, 3, and Plate XVII, 1)

is a most peculiar looking object like a projectile, and gives one the impression of being ready to shoot off on the smallest provocation. The eight spikes, reversed funnels, coming to a point, are probably responsible for this warlike appearance. The remainder of the body is occupied by two "balloons."

# Dissociation of atoms

We have now to consider the breaking up of the octahedral groups, and more and more, as we proceed, do we find that the most complicated arrangements are reducible to simple elements which are already familiar.

### Carbon (Plate III, 5, and XV, 1).

![](/img/carbon.png)

Carbon is the typical octahedron, and a clear understanding of this will enable us to follow easily the constitution and disintegration of the various members of these groups. Its appearance as a chemical atom is shown on Plate III, and see XV, 1. On the proto level the chemical atom breaks up into four segments, each consisting of a pair of funnels connected by a single atom; this is the proto element which appears at the end of each arm of the cross in titanium and zirconium. On the meta level the five six-atomed "cigars" show two neutral combinations, and the truncated "cigar" of five atoms is also neutral; the "leaves" yield two forms of triplet, five different types being thus yielded by each pair of funnels, exclusive of the linking atom. The hyper level has triplets, duads and units.

### Titanium (Plate III, 6, and XV, 2, 3).

![](/img/titanium.png)

On the proto level, the cross breaks up completely, setting free the pairs of funnels with the linking atom (a and b), as in carbon, the four bodies marked c, the twelve marked d, and the central globe marked e. The latter breaks up again, setting free its five intersecting cigar-bearing tetrahedra, which follow their usual course (see Occultum, p. 44). The eight-atomed body in the centre makes a ring of seven atoms round a central one, like that in occultum (see p. 44, diagram B), from which it only differs in having the central atom, and breaks up similarly, setting the central atom free. The ovoid c sets free its four contained globes, and the ovoid d sets free the three within it. Thus sixty-one proto elements are yielded by titanium. On the meta level, c (titanium 3) breaks up into star-like and cruciform bodies; the component parts of these are easily followed; on the hyper level, of the four forms of triplets one behaves as in carbon, and the others are shown, a, b and f; the cruciform quintet yields a triplet and a duad, c and d; the tetrahedra yield two triplets g and h, and two units; the septet, a triplet k and a quartet j. On the meta level, the bodies from d behave like their equivalents in sodium, each d shows two quartets and a sextet, breaking up, on the hyper level, into four duads and two triads.

### Zirconium (Plate XV, 2, 5).

Zirconium reproduces in its c the four forms that we have already followed in the corresponding c of titanium, and as these are set free on the proto level, and follow the same course on the meta and hyper levels, we need not repeat them. The central globe of zirconium c sets free its nine contained bodies; eight of these are similar and are figured in the diagram; it will be observed that the central body is the truncated "cigar" of carbon; their behaviour on the meta and hyper levels is easily followed there. The central sphere is also figured; the cigar follows its usual course, and its companions unite into a sextet and an octet. The d ovoid liberates five bodies, four of which we have already seen in titanium, as the crosses and sextet of sodium, and which are figured under titanium; the four quartets within the larger globe also follow a sodium model, and are given again.

### Silicon (Plate XVI, 1).

![](/img/silicon.png)

In silicon, the ovoids are set free from the funnels on the proto level, and the truncated "cigar," playing the part of a leaf, is also liberated. This, and the four "cigars," which escape from their ovoids, pass along their usual course. The quintet and quartet remain together, and form a nine-atomed body on the meta level, yielding a sextet and a triplet on the hyper.

### Germanium (Plate XVI, 2, 4).

The central globe, with its two "cigar"-bearing tetrahedra, need not delay us; the tetrahedra are set free and follow the occultum disintegration, and the central four atoms is the sodium cross that we had in titanium. The ovoids (XVI, 4) are liberated on the proto level, and the "cigar," as usual, bursts its way through and goes along its accustomed path. The others remain linked on the meta level, and break up into two triangles and a quintet on the hyper.

### Tin (Plate XVI, 3, 4).

Here we have only the spike to consider, as the funnels are the same as in germanium, and the central globe is that of titanium, omitting the eight atomed centre. The cone of the spike we have had in silver (see p. 729, May), and it is set free on the proto level. The spike, as in zinc, becomes a large sphere, with the single septet in the centre, the remaining six bodies circling round it on differing planes. They break up as shown. (Tin is Sn.)

### Iron (Plate IV, I, and XVII, 3).

![](/img/iron.png)

We have already dealt with the affinities of this peculiar group, and we shall see, in the disintegration, even more clearly, the close relationships which exist according to the classification which we here follow.

The fourteen bars of iron break asunder on the proto level, and each sets free its contents—a cone and three ovoids, which as usual, become spheres. The twenty-eight-atomed cone becomes a four-sided figure, and the ovoids show crystalline contents. They break up, on the meta level as shown in the diagram, and are all reduced to triplets and duads on the hyper level.

### Cobalt (Plate XVII, 4).

The ovoids in cobalt are identical with those of iron; the higher ovoids, which replace the cone of iron, show persistently the crystalline forms so noticeable throughout this group.

### Nickel (Plate XVII, 5).

The two additional atoms in a bar, which alone separate nickel from cobalt, are seen in the upper sphere of the central ovoid.

### Ruthenium (Plate XVIII, 1).

The lower ovoids in ruthenium are identical in composition, with those of iron, cobalt and nickel and may be studied under Iron. The upper ones only differ by the addition of a triplet.

### Rhodium (Plate XVIII, 2).

Rhodium has a septet, which is to be seen in the c of titanium (see k in the titanium diagram) and differs only in this from its group.

### Palladium (Plate XVIII, 3).

In palladium this septet appears as the upper sphere in every ovoid of the upper ring.

### Osmium (Plate XVIII, 4).

We have here no new constituents; the ovoids are set free on the proto level and the contained globes on the meta, all being of familiar forms. The cigars, as usual, break free on the proto level, and leave their ovoid with only four contained spheres, which unite into two nine-atomed bodies as in silicon (see above).

### Iridium (Plate XVIII, 5.)

The twenty-one-atomed cone of silver here reappears, and its proceedings may be followed under that metal (see diagram, p. 729, May). The remaining bodies call for no remark.

### Platinum (Plate XVIII, 6).

Again the silver cone is with us. The remaining bodies are set free on the proto level, and their contained spheres on the meta.

### Lithium (Plate IV, 2, and XIX, 1).

![](/img/lithium.png)

Here we have some new combinations, which recur persistently in its allies. The bodies a, in Plate XIX, 1, are at the top and bottom of the ellipse; they come to right and left of it in the proto state, and each makes a twelve-atomed body on the meta level.

The five bodies within the ellipse, three monads and two sextets, show two which we have had before: d, which behaves like the quintet and quartet in silicon, after their junction, and b, which we have had in iron. The two bodies c are a variant of the square-based pyramid, one atom at the apex, and two at each of the other angles. The globe, e, is a new form, the four tetrahedra of the proto level making a single twelve-atomed one on the meta. The body a splits up into triplets on the hyper; b and d follow their iron and silicon models; c yields four duads and a unit; e breaks into four quartets.

### Potassium (Plate XIX, 2).

Potassium repeats the lithium spike; the central globe shows the "nitrogen balloon," which we already know, and which is surrounded on the proto level with six tetrahedra, which are set free on the meta and behave as in cobalt. Hence we have nothing new.

### Rubidium (Plate XIX, 3).

Again the lithium spike, modified slightly by the introduction of an ovoid, in place of the top sphere; the forms here are somewhat unusual, and the triangles of the sextet revolve round each other on the meta level; all the triads break up on the hyper level into duads and units.

### Fluorine (Plate IV, 3, and Plate XVII, 1).

The reversed funnels of fluorine split asunder on the proto level, and are set free, the "balloons" also floating off independently. The funnels, as usual, become spheres, and on the meta level set free their contained bodies, three quartets and a triplet from each of the eight. The balloons disintegrate in the usual way.

### Manganese (Plate XVII, 2).

Manganese offers us nothing new, being composed of "lithium spikes" and "nitrogen balloons."
