## VI. The Star Groups.

We have now reached the last of the groups as arranged on Sir William Crookes' lemniscates, that forming the "neutral" column; it is headed by helium, which is _sui generis_. The remainder are in the form of a flat star (see Plate IV, 4), with a centre formed of five intersecting and "cigar"-bearing tetrahedra, and six radiating arms. Ten of these have been observed, five pairs in which the second member differs but slightly from the first; they are: Neon, Meta-neon; Argon, Metargon; Krypton, Meta-krypton; Xenon, Meta-xenon; Kalon, Meta-kalon; the last pair and the meta forms are not yet discovered by chemists. These all show the presence of a periodic law; taking an arm of the star in each of the five pairs, we find the number of atoms to be as follows:

```
40       99      224      363      489
47      106      231      370      496
```

It will be observed that the meta form in each case shows seven more atoms than its fellow.

Plate XX.

### Helium (Plate III, 5, and Plate XX, 1)

shows two "cigar"-bearing tetrahedra, and two hydrogen triangles, the tetrahedra revolving round an egg-shaped central body, and the triangles spinning on their own axes while performing a similar revolution. The whole has an attractively airy appearance, as of a fairy element.

```
HELIUM: Two tetrahedra of 24 atoms   48
        Two triangles of 9 atoms     18
        Central egg                   6

        Atomic weight              3.94
        Number weight 72/18        4.00
```

### Neon (Plate XX, 2 and 6)

has six arms of the pattern shown in 2, radiating from the central globe.

```
NEON: Six arms of 40 atoms       240
      Central tetrahedra         120

                                ----

      Atomic weight            19.90
      Number weight 360/18     20.00
```

### Meta-neon (Plate XX, 3 and 6)

differs from its comrade by the insertion of an additional atom in each of the groups included in the second body within its arm, and substituting a seven-atomed group for one of the triplets in neon.

```
META-NEON: Six arms of 47 atoms    282
           Central tetrahedra      120
                                  ----
Total                              402

Atomic weight                     ----
Number weight 402/18             22.33
```

### Argon (Plate XX, 4, 6 and 7)

shows within its arms the b 63 which we met in nitrogen, yttrium, vanadium and niobium, but not the "balloon," which we shall find with it in krypton and its congeners.

```
ARGON: Six arms of 99 atoms     594
       Central tetrahedra       120
                               ----
                 Total          714
                               ----
       Atomic weight          39.60
       Number weight 714/18   39.66
```

### Metargon (Plate XX, 5, 6 and 7)

again shows only an additional seven atoms in each arm.

```
METARGON: Six arms of 106 atoms   636
          Central tetrahedra      120
                                 ----

Plate XXI.

### Krypton (Plate XXI, 1 and 4, and Plate XX, 6 and 7)

contains the nitrogen "balloon," elongated by its juxtaposition to b 63. The central tetrahedra appear as usual.

```
KRYPTON:  Six arms of 224 atoms             1344
          Central tetrahedra                 120

          Number weight 1464/18            81.33
```

### Meta-Krypton differs only from krypton by the substitution of z for y in each arm of the star.

```
META-KRYPTON:  Six arms of 231 atoms        1386
               Central tetrahedra            120

               Number weight 1506/18       83.66
```

### Xenon (Plate XXI, 2 and 4, and Plate XX, 6 and 7)

has a peculiarity shared only by kalon, that x and y are asymmetrical, the centre of one having three atoms and the centre of the other two. Is this done in order to preserve the difference of seven from its comrade?

```
XENON:  Six arms of 363 atoms               2178
        Central tetrahedra                   120

        Number weight 2298/18             127.66
```

### Meta-Xenon

differs from xenon only by the substitution of two z's for x and y.

```

```

### Kalon (Plate XXI, 3 and 4, and Plate XX, 6 and 7)

has a curious cone, possessing a kind of tail which we have not observed elsewhere; x and y show the same asymmetry as in xenon.

```
KALON: Six arms of 489 atoms          2934
       Central tetrahedra              120

       Atomic weight                  ----
       Number weight 3054/18        169.66

### Meta-Kalon

again substitutes two z's for x and y.

```
META-KALON: Six arms of 496 atoms           2976
            Central tetrahedra               120

Only a few atoms of kalon and meta-kalon have been found in the air of a fair-sized room.

It does not seem worth while to break up these elements, for their component parts are so familiar. The complicated groups—a 110, b 63 and c 120—have all been fully dealt with in preceding pages.

There remains now only radium, of the elements which we have, so far, examined, and that will be now described and will bring to an end this series of observations. A piece of close and detailed work of this kind, although necessarily imperfect, will have its value in the future, when science along its own lines shall have confirmed these researches.

It will have been observed that our weights, obtained by counting, are almost invariably slightly in excess of the orthodox ones: it is interesting that in the latest report of the International Commission (November 13, 1907), printed in the Proceedings of the Chemical Society of London, Vol. XXIV, No. 33, and issued on January 25, 1908, the weight of hydrogen is now taken at 1.008 instead of at 1. This would slightly raise all the orthodox weights; thus aluminium rises from 26.91 to 27.1, antimony from 119.34 to 120.2, and so on.

### Radium.

![](/img/p22.png)

Plate XXII.

Radium has the form of a tetrahedron, and it is in the tetrahedral groups (see article IV) that we shall find its nearest congeners; calcium, strontium, chromium, molybdenum resemble it most closely in general internal arrangements, with additions from zinc and cadmium. Radium has a complex central sphere (Plate XXII), extraordinarily vivid and living; the whirling motion is so rapid that continued accurate observation is very difficult; the sphere is more closely compacted than the centre-piece in other elements, and is much larger in proportion to the funnels and spikes than is the case with the elements above named; reference to Plate VIII will show that in these the funnels are much larger than the centres, whereas in radium the diameter of the sphere and the length of the funnel or spike are about equal. Its heart consists of a globe containing seven atoms, which assume on the proto level the prismatic form shown in cadmium, magnesium and selenium. This globe is the centre of two crosses, the arms of which show respectively three-atomed and two-atomed groups. Round this sphere are arranged, as on radii, twenty-four segments, each containing five bodies—four quintets and a septet—and six loose atoms, which float horizontally across the mouth of the segment; the whole sphere has thus a kind of surface of atoms. On the proto level these six atoms in each segment gather together and form a "cigar." In the rush of the streams presently to be described one of these atoms is occasionally torn away, but is generally, if not always, replaced by the capture of another which is flung into the vacated space.

Each of the four funnels opens, as usual, on one face of the tetrahedron, and they resemble the funnels of strontium and molybdenum but contain three pillars instead of four (Plate XXIII). They stand within the funnel as though at the angles of a triangle, not side by side. The contained bodies, though numerous, contain forms which are all familiar.

The spikes alternate with the funnels, and point to the angles of the tetrahedron as in zinc and cadmium; each spike contains three "lithium spikes" (see Plate XIX) with a ten-atomed cone or cap at the top, floating above the three (Plate XXIV). The "petals" or "cigars" of lithium exist in the central globe in the floating atoms, and the four-atomed groups which form the lithium "plate" may be seen in the funnels, so that the whole of lithium appears in radium.

So much for its composition. But a very peculiar result, so far unobserved elsewhere, arises from the extraordinarily rapid whirling of the central sphere. A kind of vortex is formed, and there is a constant and powerful indraught through the funnels. By this, particles are drawn in from without, and these are swept round with the sphere, their temperature becoming much raised, and they are then violently shot out through the spikes. It is these jets which occasionally sweep away an atom from the surface of the sphere. These "particles" may be atoms, or they may be bodies from any of the etheric levels; in some cases these bodies break up and form new combinations. In fact lithium seems like a kind of vortex of creative activity, drawing in, breaking up, recombining, shooting forth—a most extraordinary element.
