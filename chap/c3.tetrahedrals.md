# The Tetrahedral Groups.

### Silver

(Plate VI, 4 and Ag below). Silver presents us with only two new bodies, and even these are only new by slight additions to old models. The triangular shaped body at the apex of the funnel, containing 21 atoms, is intermediate between the similar bodies in copper and iron. As a proto-element it becomes three triangles, joined at their apices, in fact a tetrahedron in which no atoms are distributed on the fourth face. The faces separate on the meta level and give three seven-atomed figures, and each of these breaks up into two triplets and a unit. The central globe only differs from that of bromine by the addition of one atom, which gives the familiar four-sided pyramid with a square base as in chlorine (see p. 46).

### Gold

(Plate VII and Au below)

![](/img/gold.png)

The disintegration of gold first yields forty-seven bodies on the proto-level; the twenty-four funnels separate, and the central globes which hold each twelve together set free their six contained globes (c, d), thirty bodies being thus liberated. The sixteen bodies on the central inclined planes, marked b, break away, their central globe, with its four contained globes, remaining unchanged. But this condition does not last. The motion of the funnels changes and thus the funnels cease to exist and their contents are set free, each funnel thus liberating nine independent bodies; the sixteen b separate into two each; the four a liberate five each; the two c set free thirteen each; the four d finally liberate two each: 302 proto elements in all.

The funnel is almost that of iodine, re-arranged. Four of the first ring in the iodine funnel are replaced by the triangular body, which becomes a four-sided pyramid with an occupied base. The second ring of three ovoids in iodine becomes four in gold, but the internal arrangement of each ovoid is the same. The next two spheres in the iodine funnel coalesce into one sphere, with similar contents, in the gold funnel. The fifth in iodine is slightly rearranged to form the fourth in descent in gold, and the remaining two are the same. B has been broken up under occultum (p. 628) and can be followed there. The sixteen rings set free from the four a, after gyrating round the central body, now become a sphere, break up, as in occultum (see p. 44) into a meta seven-atomed ring and an eight-atomed double cross, and so on to the hyper level. The sphere with its two contained bodies breaks up into eight triangles on the meta level, and each of these, on the hyper, into a duad and a unit. The twelve septets of c assume the form of prisms as in iodine (see p. 48) and pursue the same course, while its central body, a four-sided pyramid with its six attendants, divides on the meta level into six duads, revolving round a ring with a central atom as in chlorine (p. 47), the duads going off independently on the hyper-level and the ring breaking up as in chlorine. The "cigar" tetrahedron of d follows its course as in occultum, and the other sets free two quartets and two triplets on the meta level, yielding six duads and two units as hyper compounds. It will be seen that, complex as gold is, it is composed of constituents already familiar, and has iodine and occultum as its nearest allies.

## II. Tetrahedrals.

This group consists of beryllium (glucinum), calcium, strontium and barium, all diatomic, paramagnetic and positive. The corresponding group consists of oxygen, chromium, molybdenum, wolfram (tungsten) and uranium, with a blank disk between wolfram and uranium: these are diatomic, paramagnetic, and negative. We have not examined barium, wolfram, or uranium.

Plate VIII.

### Beryllium

(Plate III, 2, and Plate VIII, 1). In the tetrahedron four funnels are found, the mouth of each funnel opening on one of its faces. The funnels radiate from a central globe, and each funnel contains four ovoids each with ten atoms within it arranged in three spheres. In the accompanying diagrams one funnel with its four ovoids is shown and a single ovoid with its three spheres, containing severally three, four, and three atoms, is seen at the left-hand corner of the plate (7 a). The members of this group are alike in arrangement, differing only in the increased complexity of the bodies contained in the funnels. Beryllium, it will be observed, is very simple, whereas calcium and strontium are complicated.

```

Number weight  164/18              9.11
```
### Calcium

(Plate VIII, 2) shows in each funnel three contained spheres, of which the central one has within it seven ovoids identical with those of beryllium, and the spheres above and below it contain each five ovoids (7 b) in which the three contained spheres have, respectively, two, five, and two atoms. The central globe is double, globe within globe, and is divided into eight segments, radiating from the centre like an orange; the internal part of the segment belonging to the inner globe has a triangular body within it, containing four atoms (7 c), and the external part, belonging to the encircling globe, shows the familiar "cigar" (7 d). In this way 720 atoms are packed into the simple beryllium type.

```
CALCIUM: 4 funnels of 160 atoms      640
         Central globe                80

                          Total      720

         Atomic weight             39.74
         Number weight 720/18      40.00
```

### Strontium

(Plate VIII, 3) shows a still further complication within the funnels, no less than eight spheres being found within each. Each of the highest pair contains four subsidiary spheres, with five, seven, seven, five atoms, respectively (7 e, g, f). The g groups are identical with those in gold, but difference of pressure makes the containing body spherical instead of ovoid; similar groups are seen in the top ring of the iodine funnel, where also the "hole" is ovoid in form. The second pair of spheres contains ten ovoids (7 b) identical with those of calcium. The third pair contains fourteen ovoids (7 a) identical with those of beryllium, while the fourth pair repeats the second, with the ovoids re-arranged. The internal divisions of the double sphere of the central globe are the same as in calcium, but the contents differ. The "cigars" in the external segments are replaced by seven-atomed ovoids (7 h)—the iodine ovoids—and the external segments contain five-atomed triangles (7 i). Thus 1,568 atoms have been packed into the beryllium type, and our wonder is again aroused by the ingenuity with which a type is preserved while it is adapted to new conditions.

```
STRONTIUM: 4 funnels of 368 atoms       1472
           Central globe                  96

```

The corresponding group, headed by oxygen—oxygen, chromium, molybdenum, wolfram and uranium—offers us another problem in its first member.

### Oxygen

(Plate VIII, 4). This was examined by us in 1895, and the description may be reproduced here with a much improved diagram of its very peculiar constitution. The gaseous atom is an ovoid body, within which a spirally-coiled snake-like body revolves at a high velocity, five brilliant points of light shining on the coils. The appearance given in the former diagram will be obtained by placing the five septets on one side on the top of those on the other, so that the ten become in appearance five, and thus doubling the whole, the doubling point leaving eleven duads on each side. The composition is, however, much better seen by flattening out the whole. On the proto level the two snakes separate and are clearly seen.

```
OXYGEN: Positive snake

        Atomic weight              15.87
        Number weight 290/18       16.11
```

### Chromium

(Plate VIII, 5) "reverts to the ancestral type," the tetrahedron; the funnel is widened by the arrangement of its contents, three spheres forming its first ring, as compared with the units in beryllium and calcium, and the pairs in strontium and molybdenum. Two of these spheres are identical in their contents—two quintets (7 f), a quintet (7 j), and two quintets (7 e), e and f being to each other as object and image. The remaining sphere (7 b) is identical with the highest in the calcium funnel. The remaining two spheres, one below the other, are identical with the corresponding two spheres in calcium. The central globe, as regards its external segments, is again identical with that of calcium, but in the internal segments a six-atomed triangle (7 k) is substituted for the calcium four-atomed one (7 e).

```
CHROMIUM: 4 funnels of 210 atoms      840
          Central globe                96

          Atomic weight             51.74
          Number weight 936/18      52.00
```

### Molybdenum

(Plate VIII, 6) very closely resembles strontium, differing from it only in the composition of the highest pair of spheres in the funnels and in the presence of a little sphere, containing two atoms only, in the middle of the central globe. The topmost spheres contain no less than eight subsidiary spheres within each; the highest of these (7 e) has four atoms in it; the next three have four, seven and four (7 e g e), respectively; the next three are all septets (7 g), and the last has four—making in all for these two spheres 88 atoms, as against the 48 in corresponding spheres of strontium, making a difference of 160 in the four funnels.

```

## II a. Positive Tetrahedrals.

This group contains magnesium, zinc, cadmium, and mercury, with an empty disk between cadmium and mercury; we did not examine mercury. All are diatomic, diamagnetic and positive; the corresponding group consists of sulphur, selenium and tellurium, also all diatomic and diamagnetic, but negative. The same characteristics of four funnels opening on the faces of a tetrahedron are found in all, but magnesium and sulphur have no central globe, and in cadmium and tellurium the globe has become a cross.

![](/img/p9.png)

Plate IX.

### Magnesium

(Plate IX, 1) introduces us to a new arrangement: each group of three ovoids forms a ring, and the three rings are within a funnel; at first glance, there are three bodies in the funnel; on examination each of these is seen to consist of three, with other bodies, spheres, again within them. Apart from this, the composition is simple enough, all the ovoids being alike, and composed of a triplet, a septet and a duad.

```
MAGNESIUM: 4 funnels of 108 atoms     432
           Atomic weight            24.18
           Number weight 432/18     24.00
```

### Zinc

(Plate IX, 2) also brings a new device: the funnel is of the same type as that of magnesium, while septets are substituted for the triplets, and 36 additional atoms are thus slipped in. Then we see four spikes, alternating with the funnels and pointing to the angles, each adding 144 atoms to the total. The spikes show the ten-atomed triangle, already met with in other metals, three very regular pillars, each with six spheres, containing two, three, four, four, three, two atoms, respectively. The supporting spheres are on the model of the central globe, but contain more atoms. Funnels and spikes alike radiate from a simple central globe, in which five contained spheres are arranged crosswise, preparing for the fully developed cross of cadmium. The ends of the cross touch the bottoms of the funnels.

```
ZINC: 4 funnels of 144 atoms        576
      4 spikes of 144 atoms         576
      Central globe                  18

         Atomic weight            64.91
         Number weight 1170/18    65.00
```

### Cadmium

(Plate IX, 3) has an increased complexity of funnels; the diagram shows one of the three similar segments which lie within the funnels as cylinders; each of these contains four spheres, three pillars and three ovoids, like the spike of zinc turned upside down, and the zinc ten-atomed triangle changed into three ten-atomed ovoids. The centre-piece is a new form, though prefigured in the central globe of zinc.

```
CADMIUM:  3 segments of 164 atoms = 492

```

The corresponding negative group is headed by

### Sulphur

(Plate X, 1), which, like magnesium, has no central globe, and consists simply of the zinc funnels, much less compressed than zinc but the same in composition.

```
SULPHUR: 4 funnels of 144 atoms       576
         Atomic weight              31.82
         Number weight 576/18       32.00
```

### Selenium

(Plate X, 2) is distinguished by the exquisite peculiarity, already noticed, of a quivering star, floating across the mouth of each funnel, and dancing violently when a ray of light falls upon it. It is known that the conductivity of selenium varies with the intensity of the light falling upon it, and it may be that the star is in some way connected with its conductivity. It will be seen that the star is a very complicated body, and in each of its six points the two five-atomed spheres revolve round the seven-atomed cone. The bodies in the funnels resemble those in magnesium, but a reversed image of the top one is interposed between itself and the small duad, and each pair has its own enclosure. The central globe is the same as that of zinc.

```
SELENIUM: 4 funnels of 198 atoms     792
          4 stars of 153 atoms       612

          Atomic weight            78.58
          Number weight 1422/18    79.00
```

### Tellurium

(Plate X, 3), it will be seen, closely resembles cadmium, and has three cylindrical segments—of which one is figured—making up the funnel. The contained bodies in the pillars run three, four, five, four, three, two, instead of starting with two; and a quartet replaces a duad in the globes above. The central cross only differs from that of cadmium in having a seven-atomed instead of a four-atomed centre. So close a similarity is striking.

```
TELLURIUM: 3 segments of 181 atoms = 543
           4 funnels of 543 atoms          2172

```           

We must now consider the ways in which the members of the tetrahedral groups break up, and as we proceed with this study we shall find how continual are the repetitions, and how Nature, with a limited number of fundamental methods, creates by varied combinations her infinite variety of forms.

### Beryllium (Plate III, 2, and VIII, 1).

![](/img/beryllium.png)

Beryllium offers us four similar funnels and a central globe, and the proto-elements consist of these five bodies, set free. The funnel, released from pressure, assumes a spherical form, with its four ovoids spinning within it, and the central globe remains a sphere, containing a whirling cross. On the meta level, the ovoids are set free, and two from each funnel are seen to be positive, two negative—sixteen bodies in all, plus the cross, in which the resultant force-lines are changed, preparatory to its breaking into two duads on the hyper level. On that level, the decades disintegrate into two triplets and a quartet, the positive with the depressions inward, the negative with the depressions outward.

### Calcium (Plate VIII, 2).

The funnels, as usual, assume a spherical form on the proto level, and show, in each case, three spheres containing ovoids. These spheres, still on the proto level, break free from their containing funnel, as in the case of gold (p. 49), twelve bodies being thus liberated, while the central globe breaks up into eight segments, each of which becomes globular, and contains within it a "cigar" and a somewhat heart-shaped body. Four spheres, each containing seven ten-atomed ovoids, are identical with those in beryllium, and can be followed in its diagram. Eight spheres, each containing five nine-atomed ovoids of a different type, set free, on the meta level, eighty duads—forty positive and forty negative—and forty quintets, which are identical with those in chlorine. On the hyper level, the duads become single atoms, within a sphere, and the central atom from the quintet is also set free, one hundred and twenty in all. The remaining four atoms of the quintet divide into two duads.

The central globe, dividing into eight, becomes eight six-atomed spheres on the meta, the "cigar" behaving as usual, four "cigars" being positive and four negative, and becoming dissociated into triplets; the four atoms within the heart-shaped body appear as a tetrahedron, remain together on the meta level, and break up into duads on the hyper.

### Strontium (Plate VIII, 3).

The third member of this group repeats the a groups of beryllium and the b groups of calcium, and they dissociate into the bodies already described under these respectively. The two upper globes in each funnel repeat each other, but each globe contains four smaller spheres showing three varieties of forms. The two marked g, which are repeated in the central globe as h, are seven-atomed, and appear as spheres or ovoids according to pressure. They are figured on p. 48, under iodine; e and f are related as object and image, and we have already seen them in copper (pp. 38 and 48); in each case, as in copper, they unite into a ten-atomed figure; on the meta level the pair of fours form a ring, and the remaining two atoms form a duad; i, which repeats f, makes a ring with the fifth in the centre, as in the five-atomed b of calcium, as shown above. There is, thus, nothing new in strontium, but only repetitions of forms already studied.

### Oxygen (Plate VIII, 4).

![](/img/oxygen.png)

Dissociation of Oxygen, Chromium and Molybdenum.

The disintegration of oxygen as given in 1895 may be repeated here, and the better presentation given on p. 54 renders it easier to follow the process. On the proto level the two "snakes" divide; the brilliant disks are seven-atomed, but are differently arranged, the positive snake having the atoms arranged as in the iodine ovoids, whereas the negative snake has them arranged as in a capital H. The snakes show the same extraordinary activity on the proto level as on the gaseous, twisting and writhing, darting and coiling. The body of the snake is of two-atomed beads, positive and negative. On the meta level the snakes break into ten fragments, each consisting of a disk, with six beads on one side and five on the other, remaining as lively as the original snake. They shiver into their constituent disks, and beads on the hyper level, there yielding the ten disks, five positive and five negative, and the 110 beads, fifty-five positive and fifty-five negative.

### Chromium (Plate VIII, 5).

When we go on to chromium and molybdenum, we return to our familiar funnels and central globes, and the secondary spheres within the funnels—quickly set free, as before, on the proto level—give us no new combinations in their contained spheres and ovoids. The a of beryllium, the b of calcium and strontium, and d of calcium, the e and f of strontium, are all there; j in chromium is the same as the central sphere in the b ovoid. In the central globe, k, is a pair of triangles as in hydrogen, consisting of only six atoms, which on the meta level revolve round each other, and break up into two duads and two units on the hyper.

### Molybdenum (Plate VIII, 6).

Molybdenum presents us with only two new forms, and these are merely four-atomed tetrahedra, occurring in pairs as object and image. All the other bodies have already been analysed.

## II b.

We come now to the second great tetrahedral group, which though very much complicated, is yet, for the most part, a repetition of familiar forms.

### Magnesium (Plate IX, 1).

![](/img/magnesium.png)

We are still among tetrahedra, so have to do with four funnels, but each funnel contains three rings, and each ring three ovoids; on the proto level a triple dissociation takes place, for the funnels let free the rings as large spheres, in each of which rotate three twelve-atomed ovoids, and then the ovoids break loose from the spheres, and themselves become spherical, so that we have finally thirty-six proto compounds from the tetrahedron. On the meta level the contained bodies, a triplet, Mg a, a septet, Mg b, and a duad, Mg c, are set free from each globe, thus yielding one hundred and eight meta compounds. On the hyper level the triplet becomes a duad and a unit; the duad becomes two units; and the septet a triplet and a quartet.

### Zinc (Plate IX, 2).

We can leave aside the funnel, for the only difference between it and the magnesium funnel is the substitution of a second septet for the triplet, and the septet is already shown in the magnesium diagram. We have, therefore, only to consider the spikes, pointing to the angles of the enclosing tetrahedron, and the central globe. These are set free on the proto level and the spikes immediately release their contents, yielding thus thirty-two separate bodies.

The triangular arrangement at the top of the spike is the same as occurs in copper (b on p. 48), and can be there followed. One of the three similar pillars is shown in the accompanying diagram under Zn a. The compressed long oval becomes a globe, with six bodies revolving within it in a rather peculiar way: the quartets turn round each other in the middle; the triplets revolve round them in a slanting ellipse; the duads do the same on an ellipse slanting at an angle with the first, somewhat as in gold (a and b, p. 40). The spheres within the globes at the base of the spikes, Zn b, behave as a cross—the cross is a favourite device in the II a groups. Finally, the central globe, Zn c, follows the same cruciform line of disintegration.

### Cadmium (Plate IX, 3).

![](/img/cadmium.png)

Cadmium follows very closely on the lines of zinc; the pillars of the zinc spike are reproduced in the rings of the cadmium funnel; the globes are also the globes of cadmium; so neither of these needs attention. We have only to consider the three ten-atomed ovoids, which are substituted for the one ten-atomed triangle of zinc, and the central cross. The ovoids become spheres (Cd a, b), the contained bodies revolving within them, a whirling on a diameter of the sphere, cutting it in halves, as it were, and b whirling round it at right angles; the cross also becomes a sphere (Cd c), but the cruciform type is maintained within it by the relative positions of the contained spheres in their revolution. The subsequent stages are shown in the diagram.

### Sulphur (Plate XI, 1).

Sulphur has nothing new, but shows only the funnels already figured in magnesium, with the substitution of a second septet for the triplet, as in zinc.

### Selenium (Plate X, 2).

![](/img/selenium.png)

The funnel of selenium is a re-arrangement of the twelve-atomed ovoids of magnesium and the ten-atomed ovoids of cadmium. The funnels, on disintegrating, set free twelve groups, each containing nine spheres. On the meta level the ten-atomed bodies are set free, and the twelve-atomed divide into duads and decads, thus yielding seventy-two decads and thirty-six duads; the duads, however, at once recombine into hexads, thus giving only twelve meta elements, or eighty-four in all from the funnels. The central globe holds together on the proto level, but yields five meta elements. The star also at first remains a unit on the proto level, and then shoots off into seven bodies, the centre keeping together, and the six points becoming spheres, within which the two cones, base to base, whirl in the centre, and the globes circle round them. On the meta level all the thirty bodies contained in the star separate from each other, and go on their independent ways.

Selenium offers a beautiful example of the combination of simple elements into a most exquisite whole.

### Tellurium (Plate X, 3).

Tellurium very closely resembles cadmium, and they are, therefore placed on the same diagram. The pillars are the same as in chlorine and its congeners, with a duad added at the base. The ten-atomed ovoid is the same as in cadmium and follows the same course in breaking up. It would be interesting to know why this duad remains as a duad in selenium and breaks up into a septad and triad in the other members of the group. It may be due to the greater pressure to which it is subjected in selenium, or there may be some other reason. The cross in tellurium is identical with that in cadmium, except that the centre is seven-atomed instead of four-atomed.
